## Coding Test Instructions

Follow the instructions exactly as they are asked (this is critically important)
Functionality for the end-user is key here. Ask yourself, is this easy to use? 
Make sure the search function works (a few people have failed on this aspect)
Please use JSONP as requested as it won't work as well with JSON.

## How to Apply (Basic Coding Task)

Carefully follow the instructions and produce your own original work:

- Use an online code editor such as: CodePen (https://codepen.io) or Plunker (https://plnkr.co/) 
- Build a frontend UI to search the “Public Feed” Flickr JSONP API and view pics.
- Use any reactive javascript framework e.g. React, Angular, Vue
- Apply basic styling to make the end-result “not suck”
- Incorporate the following in your solution: 
    - real-time/instant results as the user type
    - image as a thumbnail
    - author
    - tags
    - link the thumbnail to the hi-res image, so the user can view that too
